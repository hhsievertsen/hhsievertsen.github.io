    I received  5,124,672 DKK from for the project "Family background, early investment policies, and parental investments". The project is based at VIVE in Copenhagen and runs from 2021-2024.<br><br>

                            <em>Project description</em><br>
                           Existing research points to the (separate) importance of early-life investment policies, family background, and parental beliefs and behaviours as key in the development of child health and human capital. However, we still have limited evidence on the interaction of those factors due to a lack of large-scale individual level data combining information on program participation, family background, parental behaviours, and children's development during childhood. We attempt to fill that gap by combining Danish administrative register data with (i) unique municipal
records on nurse home visiting and (ii) a cohort study surveying both parents of three recent cohorts of Danish children. For identification, we exploit different sources of natural (policy) variation (in screening for postpartum mental health issues and in the peer-group assignment of new mothers) and we develop an encompassing model of human capital formation based on our rich data.
